  <p>Hello there! My name is Tyler, and I'm a software developer based in Los Angeles. Welcome to my blog, where I'll be documenting various projects I'm working on and sharing things that interest me. While my primary job is in software development, I have a passion for tinkering in many areas such as hardware, cybersecurity, game development, 3D printing, and more. I know a little about a lot and love learning new things—it's one of my superpowers.</p>

<p>A few months ago, I bought a Bambu Lab P1S, and I’m completely obsessed with it. This isn't my first 3D printer (I previously had a Prusa MK3S), but the P1S has been a fantastic experience from the start. I've had this printer running almost daily. While I've mostly been printing functional items for my home, I've also used it for some cool projects like <a href="https://www.doscher.com/the-raspberry-pi-quick-kit/">the Raspberry Pi Quick Kit</a>. I wish my blog had existed when I worked on that, but luckily, the P1S has sparked a bunch of new project ideas. So, expect to see some 3D printing projects here soon!</p>
<p>Below are my P1S and some shots of the Raspberry Pi Quick Kit. Until next time!</p>
